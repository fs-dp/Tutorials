The given list is what's called an adjacency list, and it represents a graph. The number of vertices in the graph is equal to the length of edges, where each index i in edges contains vertex i 's siblings, in no particular order. Each individual edge is represented by a positive integer that denotes an index in the list that this vertex is connected to. Note that this graph is undirected, meaning that if a vertex appears in the edge list of another vertex, then the inverse will also be true.\n",
    "Also note that this graph may contain self-loops. A self-loop is an edge that has the same destination and origin; in other words, it's an edge that connects a vertex to itself. Any self-loop should make a graph not 2-colorable.\n"
