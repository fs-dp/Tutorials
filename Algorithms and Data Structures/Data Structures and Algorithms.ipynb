    "The `remove` method in the Binary Search Tree (BST) is used to delete a node with a specific value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the step-by-step explanation of how the method works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: We start from the root of the tree and initialize the `currentNode` with the root and `parentNode` as `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search for the Node to be Removed**: We traverse the tree to find the node that contains the value to be removed. If the value is less than the current node's value, we move to the left subtree. If it's greater, we move to the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Removing the Node**: Once we find the node to be removed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Case 1: The node has both left and right children**: We replace the node's value with the minimum value from the right subtree, found by using the `getMinValue()` method. After this, we call `remove` again on the right subtree to remove the node that now contains the duplicate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Case 2: The node to be removed is the root node**: If the root has a left child, we replace the root node's value with its left child's value and then set the root's left and right children to its left child's left and right children, respectively. If the root has no left child but has a right child, we do a similar operation with the right child. If the tree has only one node (i.e., the root node), we don't do anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Case 3: The node to be removed is not the root**: If the node to be removed is a left child, its parent's left child is set to the node to be removed's child if it exists, or else to its right child. The similar operation is done if the node to be removed is a right child. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Tree**: Finally, we return the root of the BST after removal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `getMinValue` method starts at a node and traverses down its left children until it reaches the left-most node, which contains the minimum value in a BST. \n"

    "If we can survive that tightest point (i.e., our fuel didn't run out at that point), it means we can survive any other point because, at any other point, we have more fuel surplus. The remaining fuel at any point is computed based on the assumption that we started from city 0, but if we start from the city just after the tightest point, we will never hit a point with less fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider a scenario where we're on a circular path, and we started tracking our fuel from a certain arbitrary point. Suppose we noticed that at some point, our fuel dropped drastically to almost empty but didn't run out. However, just after that point, there's a city with a lot of fuel, so our fuel went up again. If we had started our journey from the city just after this \"dangerous\" point, we'd never encounter a situation where we're almost out of fuel, because by the time we reach this city (on our next round), we would have a lot of fuel.\n",

    "Minesweeper is a popular video game. From Wikipedia, \"The game features a grid of clickable squares, with hidden \"mines\" scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.\" Specifically, when a player clicks on a square (also called a cell) that doesn't contain a mine, the square reveals a number representing the number of immediately adjacent mines (including diagonally adjacent mines).\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given a two-dimensional array of strings that represents a Minesweeper board for a game in progress. You're also given a row and a column representing the indices of the next square that the player clicks on the board. Write a function that returns an updated board after the click (your function can mutate the input board).\n",

    "The board will always contain only strings, and each string will be one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"M\" A mine that has not been clicked on.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"0-8\" : A cell with no mine, with an integer from 0 to 8 representing the number of adjacent mines. Note that this is a single-digit integer represented as a string. For example \"2\" would mean there are 2 adjacent cells with mines. Numbered cells are not clickable as they have already been revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the player clicks on a mine, replace the \"M\" with \"X\", indicating the game was lost.\n",

    "The code is a solution to the problem of revealing cells in a game of Minesweeper when a cell is clicked. The function click() is called with the game board and the coordinates of the clicked cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The click() function first checks whether the clicked cell contains a mine. If it does, the cell is marked with 'X' and the updated board is returned as the game is over. If not, it calls a recursive helper function dfs() to reveal the cell and possibly more cells.\n",

Otherwise, it checks all eight neighboring cells to count the number of mines.\n",

    "For each valid neighbor, if it contains a mine ('M'), the count is incremented. If the final count of neighboring mines is greater than zero, the current cell is set to the count (i.e., it's converted from 'H' to a digit representing the number of adjacent mines). If the count is zero (i.e., there are no adjacent mines), the current cell is set to '0' and the dfs() function is recursively called on all neighboring cells. This way, it continues to reveal cells until it hits a cell that has at least one neighboring mine.\n",

The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, each cell could be added to the call stack, such as in a scenario where all cells are empty and DFS traverses each one."
